"The 'dream teams' presented are the results of a machine learning project using a combination of a Deep Neural Network and the Simplex algorithm to predict points scored for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) players. All teams are predicted on unseen data and the true points scored are added after each gameweek."

"The model differentiates on positions and is trained on performances metrics like goals, assists, bonus points, fixture difficulty and goals conceded from all FPL from the seasons of 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 to predict the points scored in the present season. "

"The Neural Network predicts scores for each player for the coming gameweek based on historical statistics. The Simplex algorithm is used to produce the optimal team based on the same constraints as in the game. The maximum total cost of the team is set to be 83 as this account for the cheapest possible bench. "
