What is this?
The "dream teams" presented are the results of a machine learning project using a combination 
of a Deep Neural Network and the Simplex algorithm to predict points scored for Fantasy Premier 
League (FPL) players. All teams are predicted on unseen data and the true points scored are added 
after each gameweek. 

Models
The model differentiates on positions and is trained on performances metrics like goals, assists, 
bonus points, fixture difficulty and goals conceded from all FPL from the seasons of 2016/2017 to 
2019/2020 to predict the points scored in the present season. 

Finding the best team
The Neural Network predicts scores for each player for the coming gameweek based on historical 
statistics. The Simplex algorithm is used to produce the optimal team based on the same constraints 
as in the game. The maximum total cost of the team is set to be 83 as this account for the cheapest 
possible bench. 

How well does the team perform?
For gameweek 4 to 9 the predicted team comfortably outperforms the official FPL scout selection 
and averages a score of X which would see it performing among the top 2% players of the game. 
Note that the team has unlimited transfers for each round so the results are not absolutely 
comparable to real players, but are still impressive. 

Future work
We plan on continuously updating the models with more statistics like xG, odds and chance of 
playing as well as developing a more sophisticated model capable of making strategic decisions 
on transfers, wildcards and chips.
